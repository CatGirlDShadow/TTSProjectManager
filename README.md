# CLI tool to build Tabletop Simulator projects

## usage: 
`projectmanager load <file>` to load your project into /Project directory
`projectmanager build [path]` to build current directory [path directory] into Build.json containing the save.

note that build time is updated when you build project. to avoid this use -ne (--no-edit) flag
